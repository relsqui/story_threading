As the day drew to a close, {proto} and {sk} were just cresting the top of a wooded hill. On the far side, a bustling town lay protected in the bottom of a valley. As {proto} was looking around for a good place to make camp for the night, {sk} bounded back suddenly from gathering firewood.

"{proto}! I found something!" {sk.they} exclaimed.

"What is it?" {proto} asked.

"I'm not sure. Come see." {proto} followed {sk.them} back to a nearby clearing, which as dark fell was still illuminated by a dim, pulsing glow.

"What the ..." {proto} walked all around the contraption in the middle of the clearing. It was half-buried, and the bushes around it were singed and broken.

{sk}'s eyes got huge. "We should fly it! Do think we can?"

"We'd have to get into it first." {proto} arrived at the hatch. {proto.They} prodded it firmly, but it didn't budge. "Nothing's really regrown around it yet," {proto} observed. "I don't think it's been here very long."

"Someone in the town must have seen it come down," {sk} pointed out. "Maybe they know whose it is and what happened to them."

{proto} nodded. "We can ask around tomorrow. First, let's get some sleep."


The next day, {proto} and {sk} headed down into the town. They spent the morning exploring together and made a rough map of landmarks.

{proto} peered over the map. "Okay, first I'm going to check out ..."
