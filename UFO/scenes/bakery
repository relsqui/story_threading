"Spaceship, huh?" The woman in the bakery looked thoughtful. {proto} nibbled politely on a cookie. "Is that what that was? Hallie, the astronomer, told me it was a meteorite."

"It sure looked like a spaceship to me," {proto} said.

"That's probably it what it is, then," the baker replied amiably. While she talked, she was deftly applying frosting to a tray of cupcakes. "So you're going to try to fly it, huh? Where are you taking off from?"

"We haven't thought about it," {proto} admitted. "It's up on the hill right now."

The baker clucked her tongue. "Does that thing have rockets on it? It could start a fire! No, you'll want somewhere nice and clear to launch." She finished the tray, set it aside, and pulled out another one. "Have you seen the big fairground on the other side of town? That might do, unless it's too wide for the little road that goes out there. How big is this thing, anyway?"

{proto} held out their arms, trying to approximate the curve of the spaceship's side. "Like this? But all the way around."

The baker shook her head. "That doesn't mean much to me. But the road's about fifteen feet wide, so you'll need to figure out just how big this ship of yours is if you want to get it to the fairground."

"Do you have a tape measure?" {proto} asked hopefully.

The baker laughed. "Yes, of course I do, but it's cake-sized, not spaceship-sized." She finished frosting the second tray of cupcakes, took a small fabric tape measure out of her apron, and set it on the counter.

At that moment, a loud buzzer sounded from the back of the shop. The baker excused herself and hustled back to take another tray of treats out of the oven. {proto} waited, fiddling with the tape measure. {proto.They} noticed a stack of cardboard cake plates on the end of the counter and started to experiment.

The tape measure was long enough to go all the way around the plate: [38.7] inches. It was hard to measure the width exactly across the center, but {proto} did {proto.their} best and decided it was about [12] inches.

Next, {proto} looked around and found some cups by a pitcher of water in the corner. {proto.They} measured around the base of a cup and found it was [10] inches around. Then they turned it over and measured straight across the bottom, and got about [3.2] inches.

Finally, {proto} looked at the round lamp on the table beside the pitcher. The top of its shade was [44] inches around. Using the frame of the shade as a guide, {proto.they} measured straight across the center. It was [14] inches across.

{proto} had just set the tape measure back down on the counter when the baker came back into the front of the shop, pushing a rack of cookie trays.

"Sorry about that," she said cheerfully. "Get any ideas about how you're going to figure out if your spaceship will fit down that old road?"

"I think so," said {proto}. "Thanks for your help!"


Late that evening, {proto} met {sk} back at the ship.

"How'd it go?" asked {sk}.

{proto} explained what the baker had suggested about the fairground. "What about you?" {proto.they} asked.

"I found out that {background}," {sk} explained.

"Huh. That's interesting," said {proto}.

"I know," {sk} agreed. {sk.They} stared pensively at the ship for a while before asking, "Do you think it will fit on the road? Fifteen feet isn't that wide, and we don't have a way to measure it."

"Maybe we do." {proto} took out {proto.their} notes. "I measured some circles in the bakery, and there seems to be a pattern."

{proto.They} looked over the pairs of measurements again and made a table, then added an extra column.

[Table of measurements with new column for ratio, first one filled in. Pause until the others are filled in, correctly within an appropriate margin. Hint: Divide the circumfrence of each object by its diameter.]

"They're all the same," {sk} noticed. "Or more or less the same."

"I knew it!" {proto} shook the paper around excitedly. "We can use this to figure out how big the spaceship is."

"How?" {sk} wanted to know. "We still don't have a measuring tape big enough to go around it."

"We don't need one. Look." {proto} reached out and touched the side of the ship, spreading {proto.their} fingers out. "My hand just barely reaches between lights."

"How big is your hand, though?"

"Just about [8] inches wide, spread out like this."

[Image of hand spread across tape measure, pause until width is filled in. Hint: Measure one hand, spread out, from thumb to pinky.]

{sk} blinked. "How do you know that?"

{proto} grinned. "I measured it while I was in the bakery! I thought it might come in handy."

"... right. Well, okay, the gaps are about [8] inches wide, but what about the lights?"

{proto} gingerly touched one, then stretched {proto.their} hand across it. "Huh, they're barely warm. And it looks like they're about the same size as the gaps ... I'm going to need a pen." {proto.They} began scribbling notes again. "Hey {sk}, how many lights are there?"

{sk} jogged a quick lap around the spaceship. When {sk.they} got back, {sk.they} reported, "[30]."

[Image of the ship, seen from above. Pause until number is filled in. Hint: Count the lights.]

"Okay." {proto} started filling in {proto.their} notes. "[30] gaps times [8] inches is [240] inches. And [30] lights times [8] inches is the same."

[Pause until product is filled in. Check for accuracy. Hint: Multiply 30 by 8.]

"So the total distance all the way around is [240] plus [240] ... [480] inches?" {sk} tried.

"Right. And if it follows the same pattern as all the stuff I measured earlier, we can divide it by [3.1] and get ... [155] inches across."

[Pause until diameter is filled in. Hint: Divide the circumfrence by the ratio you found earlier.]

"Or [13] feet," {sk} finished. "Since there are 12 inches in a foot."

[Pause until feet are filled in. Hint: Divide the number of inches by 12.]

"So it will fit!" {proto} clapped. "Just barely."

{sk} yawned. "Well, that's one problem solved. Next I'm going to tackle the one where I get some sleep."

{proto} grinned, then caught {proto.themselves} also yawning. "Yeah, all right, that seems like a good idea. I'm still wondering something, though. {question}"

"Good question. Maybe we can figure it out tomorrow."


The next day, {proto} reviewed the map and set off towards the town.
