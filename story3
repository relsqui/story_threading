After a thoughtful silence, Izzy said simply, "I journeyed across the ocean looking for a perfect stone. A gem of great size, still rough from the earth, of high quality ..."

She trailed off, and shook her head. "There are plenty of cut gems for sale or trade, and a few whose rough edges simply hide internal flaws. But nothing like what I’m trying to replace. That piece was one of a kind."

"So what are you going to do now?" you asked sympathetically.

"The only thing I can do," Izzy replied. "Go home and face my mistake. I will beg my uncle’s forgiveness for destroying a treasure, and ask to continue my apprenticeship. If not?" She shrugged helplessly. "I’m good with my hands, and I’ve grown accustomed now to traveling. I’ll go back to the road, and find what opportunity I may."
