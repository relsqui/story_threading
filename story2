"You were telling me about growing up and learning stone carving," you encouraged after a moment.

Izzy nodded and continued. "One day my uncle bought an incredible stone from a traveling trader: a large carnelian, still rough and unpolished. He saw the promise in it and set it aside for a later work, but he never told me what he had in mind.

"For years the carnelian waited on a shelf in his workshop, and as my skills improved I grew sure I could make it into something beautiful. But every time I asked, he told me no, no, he had something in mind, no, not yet."

Izzy sighed.

"I didn’t believe him. I assumed he just thought I wasn’t ready, that he would rather let the carnelian gather dust forever than permit me to let out its potential. Finally one day, my uncle left me alone to go visit one of my cousins. I decided to do it. I would carve the stone and make something beautiful to show him when he got back."

Izzy hung her head and was quiet for a moment. You waited in silence until she was ready to continue.

"I broke it," she said at last. "Not just a crack or a blemish--I slipped and let the drill pierce the center. It hit a weak point and split into two halves. It’s a wonder my fingers are intact, I was so careless. Although sometimes I wish I’d broken a finger instead of the gem." Tears welled up at the memory, and she brushed them away lightly. "I was sure he would never forgive me. I was so ashamed that I threw both pieces into  the lake outside our door. I wanted to just run away, or give up carving forever. But I knew that wouldn’t fix anything, and I couldn’t put the carnelian back together. There was only one thing I could do that would actually help."
