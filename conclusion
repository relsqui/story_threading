After almost a week on the road, the squawk of gulls overhead heralded your approach to a modest shipping town. Its harbor was small and shallow, but its great distance from the larger port far up the coast still attracted a few ships whose destinations were further southward. You spent the afternoon exploring the piers with Izzy, and found three ships readying to make ocean crossings: one whose cargo was bound for Kraeg, one for Jaywood, and one for Hiri.

Izzy spoke to each captain, and then rejoined you with a sigh.

"I found a berth on the ship that’s going home, but I still don’t have quite enough to pay for it, and they’re casting off in just a few minutes." For the first time, you heard clearly the homesickness in her voice. "I can’t let it go, not after all this time." Izzy’s face turned hopeful. "It’s not too much. Only thirty crows short. Maybe I can find someone in town who’ll buy …" She glanced down at her bag, and with a pang you remembered the soapstone bear. Before you could say anything, Izzy hurried away.

Thirty crows. The toll at the mountain pass. There was plenty of money left in your pouch, and it didn’t take long to reach a decision. But you had to act quickly to get the fare to the right captain and go after Izzy before she sold the beautiful sculpture.

What had you learned about Kraeg, Jaywood, and Hiri? The people? The trade? The terrain? What had you learned about Izzy?

Which ship would take her home?
